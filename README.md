# ARP Spoofing Tool

This project is an ARP spoofing tool written in Rust that allows security researchers to capture ARP traffic on a network, carry out ARP spoofing attacks, and conduct in-depth analysis of ARP spoofing-related activities. Here is a summary of the main modules and functions of this tool:

## Project Status

> **This project is currently in development.**

## ARP Traffic Capture Module

This module is responsible for capturing and recording ARP traffic on the network.

- [ ] `capture_arp_packets`: Initiates the capture of ARP packets on the network.
- [ ] `get_victim_mac(ip_address)`: Retrieves the MAC address of a victim based on their IP address.
- [ ] `get_router_mac()`: Obtains the MAC address of the router or gateway on the network.
- [ ] `log_arp_packet(packet)`: Logs and stores captured ARP packets.
- [ ] `analyze_arp_traffic(packets)`: Performs an analysis of captured ARP packets to detect suspicious patterns.

## ARP Injection Module

This module is responsible for creating and sending fake ARP packets in the network.

- [ ] `craft_arp_packet(src_mac, src_ip, target_mac, target_ip)`: Creates fake ARP packets with custom MAC and IP addresses.
- [ ] `send_arp_packet(packet)`: Sends fake ARP packets to victims and the router.
- [ ] `restore_arp_table(victim_mac, victim_ip, router_mac, router_ip)`: Restores the ARP table of victims and the router to their original state when necessary.

## ARP Spoofing Module

This module automates the ARP spoofing process between the victim and the attacker.

- [ ] `arp_spoof_victim(victim_ip, victim_mac)`: Initiates ARP spoofing for the victim.
- [ ] `arp_spoof_router(router_ip, router_mac)`: Spoofs the router's MAC address to victims.
- [ ] `arp_spoof_cleanup()`: Safely stops and reverses ARP spoofing.

## Logging and Analysis Module

This module is responsible for registering and analyzing ARP spoofing-related activities.

- [ ] `log_arp_spoofing_activity(activity)`: Records ARP spoofing activities performed during the investigation.
- [ ] `analyze_arp_spoofing_effects(effects)`: Evaluates the impact of ARP spoofing attacks on the network.

## Protection and Detection Module

This module implements techniques for detecting and preventing ARP spoofing attacks.

- [ ] `detect_arp_spoofing()`: Detects ARP spoofing on the network using techniques such as monitoring the ARP table and MAC address comparison.
- [ ] `prevent_arp_spoofing()`: Implements measures to prevent or mitigate ARP spoofing attacks on the network.

This project provides a comprehensive tool for security researchers and network professionals looking to explore and protect their networks against ARP spoofing attacks.
